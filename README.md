# Haxe Libraries
HxLibs is a collection of 3rd party libraries ported to Haxe 2, used for Adobe Flash games I made at Piron Games.

This is a companion to [hxgamelib](https://github.com/stefandee/hxgamelib). 

It contains a variety of sites ("arcades") and services APIs for which I've sold licenses to/make specific builds due to popularity (e.g. Kongregate high-scores, ads through CPMStar and Mochi). These APIs came, overwhelmingly, for ActionScript 3, as it was much more popular, hence the need to port them to Haxe.

There are also cryptography and fast list utilities (huge improvements over builtin Haxe 2 versions) and an XM module tracker player.

This code is not relevant any longer and it's released for preservation purposes.
